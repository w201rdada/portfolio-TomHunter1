## Saving Goals for the Chronically Ill

Across that water, I bought 40 acres of land almost 20  years ago, I just sold it for 65K and acre. 

Urbanization and development has been happening for the past 40 years. This slow march of humanity is progressed and alongside it, an empire was built. This solution seeks to solve the current problem with land speculation. The current philosophy and mantra for For land speculation is to hold for decades. Using spatial analytics, old satellite imagery,  business data, Census data, and public Land record values. We are seeking to create an AI to calculate future expected land valuations specific tested time periods. 


## Study Goals & Project Plan

Outside the scope of this plan are to study other potential factor such as economic incentive plans,  tax incentives, state development plans, due to the highly subjective and opaque deals. 

Biases:
Potential pitfalls to lookout for Selection bias, Availability bias.

Supervised Machine learning models will be fed with 40 years of historic US based land development data records, with the key goal of this data is to create AI that will forecast future urbanization based off past development and design an estimation price model for land with similar characteristics. 

Data to be used:
Zillow
Census Data
Dunn and Bradd Street Data
Historic Traffic Records
Public Record Land valuation.

## Future Plans for the Study

What we are hoping to do is create a highly accurate statistical model that will enable us to look into future speculation In new.This is still be executed only United States.
