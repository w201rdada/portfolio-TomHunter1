<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Opportunity in Crisis</h2>
<p>A headline flashes, warning of the impending doom of the next category 5 hurricane, barreling toward land near an urban metropolitan area. In the short term, tens of thousands of people are predicted to be without power, water, food - the necessities for survival. The hurricane’s wake leaves short- and long-term catastrophic property damage due to water and wind, and eventually closure or financial ruin of local businesses and communities. To rebuild, economic development plans attempt to incentivize local businesses by mitigating property damage requiring new structures. The subsequent debt required to fund them puts stress on the businesses to shake the impact. In the past decade, hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Maria, Sandy, and Irma left in their wake an estimated 50 - 125 billion dollars in damage per storm <span class="citation">(Administration <a href="#ref-national_oceanic_and_atmospheric_administration_costliest_2018">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Homes impacted by severe property damage, and not covered by flood insurance, creates an interesting but ethically vague opportunity. Since much of the economic impact can be attributed to property damage, there are often property owners without the financial means to rebuild, or pay upkeep due to existing financial obligations. This causes a spike in forecloses and sales of property below the market value pre-hurricane. <span class="citation">(Kowitt <a href="#ref-kowitt_climate_2017">2017</a>)</span> Essentially creating three meaningul opportunities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Angel Investing - An outside third party creates a short-term loan against a portion of the proceeds of the home’s future price.</li>
<li>Outright Ownership - A third party purchases properties outright, develops or renovates the land, rents the property for 5-10 years effectively purchasing the home at a discount, increasing ROI and maintaining existing operations.</li>
<li>New Lending - A third party extends a second line of capital to rebuild, which is collateralized against the building. The best scenario would be the mortgage issuer who has a stake in the having the original mortgage paid off and the worst case scenario would be a predatory lending agency who offers a high risk second morgartgage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two key demographics of potential clients for this service are real estate investment companies, real estate investment funds, angel investors, issuing mortgage companies land speculators interested in holding properties for a 5-10 year period.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the stakeholders and their impact by this solution: * The Homeowners - Impacted by the storm, this product has the potential to impact their net worth and ultimately the sell price of their property. * The City or State - Are economically incentivized to return land and local economy to post-storm levels as a humanitarian and fiscal effort to raise lost tax revenue. * The Original Mortgage Issuer - Although, likely to have been packaged and resold. The issuer essentially created a loan now with a low probability of repayment, impacting their reputation and their business. * An Outside Investor - Outside investors have the largest opportunity, with capital to flood the market they can essentially invest in crisis.</p>
<p>How do you identify where these opportunities at their maximum and most likelihood of payout?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Client, Study Goals &amp; Project Plan:</h2>
<p>This study attempts to assess the financial real estate valuation of hurricanes and identify undervalued property post-devastation for the purposes of renovation and reinvestment. The plan to address this impact will follow the listed core assumptions laid out in the Project Plan, along with best starting points to validate those assumptions.</p>
<p>The general theory is as follows, home values decline after the impact of a major Hurricane due to wind, water and property damage. Catastrophic damage to homes uncovered by National Flood Insurance are typically under-valued due to the owners lack of financial resources to rebuild, repair or remortgage and the corresponding damage. Next, by examining public record, the same homes impacted by the storm have recovered their value or a significant portion of their prior estimated list price, post-storm. By using these as features, and the extent of the damage, a ML model could successfully predict homes expected to be the most undervalued and the most likely to recover their value post-storm.</p>
<p>Project Plan:</p>
<p>Core Assumptions: 1. Home values decline after the impact of a Hurricane. 1. If they do decline, the impact follows a predictable pattern, caused by the impact of the storm. 2. Any model of property damage can be inferred on future or independant Hurricane scenarios. 2. Impacted US home values stabilize and increase 5-10 years after the impact of of a Hurricane. 1. Renovations do not cost more than the price of the home. 2. Homes sold prior to and post Hurricanes are ‘Profitable’. 3. Property Valuation and Financial Model: There are two suggested methods of opportunities when investing in disaster properties. Can a model suggesting the expected sale price of a property be validated as successful?</p>
<p>Assumption Validation &amp; Project Plan:</p>
<p>Assumption 1- i &amp; ii: * Using hurricanes since 2000, study landfall and determine the radius from landfall needed to assess a material impact. * Using Zillow’s API of historic property values and public record sales and purchases and Zestimate values. Study the before and after effects of the property market prior to and post-landfall. * Determine if general rules can be applied between disaster areas regarding the sale price of properties.</p>
<p>Assumption 2- i &amp; ii: * Using Zillow’s API, looking forward in time regarding price, how long does it take the real estate market to recover their value after natural disasters? * To what extent are the homes entirely remodeled due to water damage?</p>
<p>Assumption 3: * Based on the findings of past data, can it successfully be inferred that our model can identify properties with the highest expected ROI?</p>
<p>Data Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zillow- Public Record Land Sales</li>
<li>NOAA- National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Data</li>
<li>NOAA- Satellite imagery near landfall of hurricane</li>
<li>National Flood Insurance- a list of data for who is insured against floods?</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Ethical Considerations, Biases and Future Plans</h2>
<p>The ethical considerations of arbitraging real estate in disaster scenarios leads itself to a natural discussion. Ultimately, damage from hurricanes are likely to materially impact the sale value of a property. Homeowners are likely to need financial relief to rebuild, which leads itself to seemingly-Faustian pacts between buyers, lenders and owners. Nothing prevents a homeowner from being ripped off on an uninsured home suffering from lack of flood insurance. It’s the homeowner who ultimately takes a loss on their property, so they aren’t financially exploited. On the positive side, the tool could also increase the number of buyers in the market and lead to a net increase in demand for damaged properties.</p>
<p>Important to note, this tool could be biased towards buying homes in low income neighborhoods, which are less likely to own flood insurance and are more likely to be profitable because the price of the home is low. This would need to be addressed prior to release.</p>
<p>Going forward, the application can be further built out to understand the long term impact of the economics of natural disasters on real estate. Disaster has a unique ability forcefully impact the results of normal pricing markets and the gap is ripe for a data driven company to stand-in and arbitrage the gaps. Recruitment of real estate investing companies and Angel Investors seeking to own portions of homes could help resolve the terrible implications of a Hurricane.</p>
