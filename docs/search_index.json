Have you ever posted to a message thread searching for advice on a goal? Dozens of strangers respond with their best ideas. The user frantically searching for the best thread of advice, an unfortunate subject of an opaque experiment on the wisdom of the crowd. Everything hinges on a stranger’s rough opinions, there’s no validation, just the best advice from the most eloquent randomly-assigned stranger. Advice threads like Reddit or StackOverflow offer a forum for community validation, the best responses are upvoted and the worst comments are down-voted by the community. There’s a challenge with this model, advice can help define the path to achievement of a goal, but it doesn’t help a user stay the course, maintain engaged or follow up on their progress. This project aims to resolve these challenges by using NLP on advice threads to drive suggestions, data collection from study subject’s personality characteristics on goal completion and prescriptive analytics on user engagement via touchpoints to improve longitudinal completion of goals by creating a decision support system that makes recommendations based on characteristics unique to the user.. 1.2 Mapping Goals from success to failure. The big question this project seeks to tackle is given advice from threads to what measureable effect does personality have in determining the completion of a goal. Using this as a base measurement, can the likelihood of success improve when a user is given NLP derived by Drucker’s S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time Limited) styled goals and action items? (Drucker 1954) Lastly, to improve user engagement, can the application of Self-Efficacy, Grit and perseverance concepts written by researchers such as Angela Duckworth and Alfred Bandura enable a user to accomplish the goal and stay engaged relative to no advice at all? To limit the initial scope of study, to be qualified as a goal, it must be acquisition of a skill that can be tracked in a measurable outcome. For example, the fundamentals of a programming language, the frequency and duration of regular exercise are both measurable and quantifiable, via statistics measured from knowledge checks, aptitude tests or a fitbit or smart device. Grit and Self-Efficacy are distinct but similar ideas. Duckworth describes her research as the balance between Self-Control and Grit, both ideas tied closely to predicting goal achievement through perseverance and completion of long term goal setting. [Duckworth (2016) Bandura introduced the idea of Self-Efficacy in 1977 an influential factor of cognitive motivation and goal setting through personal belief in self. (Bandura 1997) Both of these ideas seem to play an important factor in motivation, self-belief, goal setting, perseverance and goal completion, which is why this is critical in application to be measured in the study. 1.3 Project Plan There are three key priorities to stand-up the project: NLP from Advice Forums: Comments need to be to be qualified, weighted by upvotes so the best responses can be measured and referred to a user. Once this is created, this is considered user content sourced to them for a given goal. If the scope is limited to the acquisition of a programming skill, an example could be compared against a longitudinal aptitude study. Grit and Self-Efficacy Scales: Using a combination of questions similar to Duckworth’s Grit Scale (???) along with questions from Bandura’s Self-Efficacy research, the goal of the study is to hone in on particular character traits that may influence the user to diverge from goal completion. Besides a general understanding of possible causes of divergent behavior, this could be used to create prescriptive models attempting to prompt the user back on track to goal completion. Customized S.M.A.R.T: Based on the input from personality assessments listed above, modify the NLP content recommendations specific to the user. Historic information informs goals of similar users and tracking through measurable goals and or frequency of completion of goals helps predict which recomdentation actually help the user acquire their stated skill. 1.4 How an App to monitor the study might work The user supplies a personality assessment and chooses from a range of predefined goals along with the ability to define their own goals. Based on the results of the personality test, previous similar users and the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on advice threads are weighted to determine the predicted recommendation. As an interface, the app creates a visualization of a plant growing into a tree with interactable touch points. When each touch point is clicked it allows the user to see their SMART goals, and how not completing any given step might influence the probability of success. Finally, the app prompts notifications to encourage the user to make smaller steps to enabling Grit / Self-Efficacy principles or recommendations defined by Angela Duckworth or Alfred Bandura. These are prescriptive analytics are customized to the specific user and are designed to increase resilience and endurance when aiming toward long term goals by issuing small lifestyle suggestions. 1.5 Closing Comments A decision support system, doesn’t take the role of replacing mentors, coaches or teachers. It is a way to provided targeted and customized results to a given user about choices to improve probability of success in goal achievement. This app uses predictive analytics to determine the best advice given a user’s personality and encouraged the development of GRIT / Self-Efficacy key characteristics , which is overall a strong predictor of goal completion.

Urbanization and development has been happening for the past 40 years. This slow march of humanity is progressed and alongside it, an empire was built. This solution seeks to solve the current problem with land speculation. The current philosophy and mantra for For land speculation is to hold for decades. Using spatial analytics, old satellite imagery, business data, Census data, and public Land record values. We are seeking to create an AI to calculate future expected land valuations specific tested time periods. 2.2 Study Goals &amp; Project Plan Outside the scope of this plan are to study other potential factor such as economic incentive plans, tax incentives, state development plans, due to the highly subjective and opaque deals. Biases: Potential pitfalls to lookout for Selection bias, Availability bias. Supervised Machine learning models will be fed with 40 years of historic US based land development data records, with the key goal of this data is to create AI that will forecast future urbanization based off past development and design an estimation price model for land with similar characteristics. Data to be used: Zillow Census Data Dunn and Bradd Street Data Historic Traffic Records Public Record Land valuation. 2.3 Future Plans for the Study What we are hoping to do is create a highly accurate statistical model that will enable us to look into future speculation In new.This is still be executed only United States.
