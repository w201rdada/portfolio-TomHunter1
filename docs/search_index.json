Researchers like Angela Duckworth and Alfred Bandura, have demonstrated that specific human characteristics are the most predictive to goal completion. This study aims to design a customized application based on these characteristics to incentive to maintain motivation on education for students. Curated with content specifically developed for maintaining Grit and Self Efficacy. 0.0.2 Abstract: Disaster Centric Real Estate Valuation (D-CREV) The devastation caused from recent hurricanes to metropoletan areas and a lack of coverage by National Flood Insurance creates an unusual real estate arbitrage opporunity. Uninsured flooded homes unable to renovate, sell marketly below prior estimated list prices due to damage from the storm. This study aims to examine public and private data sources to determine the validity of homes impacted by flooding from Hurricanes and if findings show they recover their value, the characteristics of these investments.

Have you ever posted to a message thread searching for advice on a goal? Dozens of strangers respond with their best ideas. The user frantically searching for the best thread of advice, an unfortunate subject of an opaque experiment on the wisdom of the crowd. Everything hinges on a stranger’s rough opinions, there’s no validation, just the best advice from the most eloquent randomly-assigned stranger. Advice threads like Reddit or StackOverflow offer a forum for community validation, the best responses are upvoted and the worst comments are down-voted by the community. There’s a challenge with this model, advice can help define the path to achievement of a goal, but it doesn’t help a user stay the course, maintain engaged or follow up on their progress. This project aims to resolve these challenges by using NLP on advice threads to drive suggestions, data collection from study subject’s personality characteristics on goal completion and prescriptive analytics on user engagement via touchpoints to improve longitudinal completion of goals by creating a decision support system that makes recommendations based on characteristics unique to the user.. 1.2 Mapping Goals from success to failure. The big question this project seeks to tackle is given advice from threads to what measureable effect does personality have in determining the completion of a goal. Using this as a base measurement, can the likelihood of success improve when a user is given NLP derived by Drucker’s S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time Limited) styled goals and action items? (Drucker 1954) Lastly, to improve user engagement, can the application of Self-Efficacy, Grit and perseverance concepts written by researchers such as Angela Duckworth and Alfred Bandura enable a user to accomplish the goal and stay engaged relative to no advice at all? To limit the initial scope of study, to be qualified as a goal, it must be acquisition of a skill that can be tracked in a measurable outcome. For example, the fundamentals of a programming language, the frequency and duration of regular exercise are both measurable and quantifiable, via statistics measured from knowledge checks, aptitude tests or a fitbit or smart device. Grit and Self-Efficacy are distinct but similar ideas. Duckworth describes her research as the balance between Self-Control and Grit, both ideas tied closely to predicting goal achievement through perseverance and completion of long term goal setting. [Duckworth (2016) Bandura introduced the idea of Self-Efficacy in 1977 an influential factor of cognitive motivation and goal setting through personal belief in self. (Bandura 1997) Both of these ideas seem to play an important factor in motivation, self-belief, goal setting, perseverance and goal completion, which is why this is critical in application to be measured in the study. 1.3 Project Plan There are three key priorities to stand-up the project: NLP from Advice Forums: Comments need to be to be qualified, weighted by upvotes so the best responses can be measured and referred to a user. Once this is created, this is considered user content sourced to them for a given goal. If the scope is limited to the acquisition of a programming skill, an example could be compared against a longitudinal aptitude study. Grit and Self-Efficacy Scales: Using a combination of questions similar to Duckworth’s Grit Scale (???) along with questions from Bandura’s Self-Efficacy research, the goal of the study is to hone in on particular character traits that may influence the user to diverge from goal completion. Besides a general understanding of possible causes of divergent behavior, this could be used to create prescriptive models attempting to prompt the user back on track to goal completion. Customized S.M.A.R.T: Based on the input from personality assessments listed above, modify the NLP content recommendations specific to the user. Historic information informs goals of similar users and tracking through measurable goals and or frequency of completion of goals helps predict which recomdentation actually help the user acquire their stated skill. 1.4 How an App to monitor the study might work The user supplies a personality assessment and chooses from a range of predefined goals along with the ability to define their own goals. Based on the results of the personality test, previous similar users and the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on advice threads are weighted to determine the predicted recommendation. As an interface, the app creates a visualization of a plant growing into a tree with interactable touch points. When each touch point is clicked it allows the user to see their SMART goals, and how not completing any given step might influence the probability of success. Finally, the app prompts notifications to encourage the user to make smaller steps to enabling Grit / Self-Efficacy principles or recommendations defined by Angela Duckworth or Alfred Bandura. These are prescriptive analytics are customized to the specific user and are designed to increase resilience and endurance when aiming toward long term goals by issuing small lifestyle suggestions. 1.5 Closing Comments A decision support system, doesn’t take the role of replacing mentors, coaches or teachers. It is a way to provided targeted and customized results to a given user about choices to improve probability of success in goal achievement. This app uses predictive analytics to determine the best advice given a user’s personality and encouraged the development of GRIT / Self-Efficacy key characteristics , which is overall a strong predictor of goal completion.

In the short term, tens of thousands of people are predicted to be without power, water, food - the necessities for survival. The hurricane’s wake leaves short- and long-term catastrophic property damage due to water and wind, and eventually closure or financial ruin of local businesses and communities. To rebuild, economic development plans attempt to incentivize local businesses by mitigating property damage requiring new structures. The subsequent debt required to fund them puts stress on the businesses to shake the impact. In the past decade, hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Maria, Sandy, and Irma left in their wake an estimated 50 - 125 billion dollars in damage per storm (Administration 2018). RANK NAME (IMPACTED AREA) YEAR DAMAGE (U.S.) 1 KATRINA (SE FL, LA, MS) 2005 $125,000,000,000 2 HARVEY (TX, LA) 2017 $125,000,000,000 3 MARIA (US VIRGIN ISLANDS) 2018 $80,000,000,000 4 SANDY(Mid-Atlantic &amp; NE US) 2012 65,000,000,000 5 IRMA (FL) 2017 50,000,000,000 Homes impacted by severe property damage, and not covered by flood insurance, creates an interesting but ethically vague opportunity. Since much of the economic impact can be attributed to property damage, there are often property owners without the financial means to rebuild, or pay upkeep due to existing financial obligations. This causes a spike in forecloses and sales of property below the market value pre-hurricane. (Kowitt 2017) Essentially creating three meaningul opportunities: Angel Investing - An outside third party creates a short-term loan against a portion of the proceeds of the home’s future price. Outright Ownership - A third party purchases properties outright, develops or renovates the land, rents the property for 5-10 years effectively purchasing the home at a discount, increasing ROI and maintaining existing operations. New Lending - A third party extends a second line of capital to rebuild, which is collateralized against the building. The best scenario would be the mortgage issuer who has a stake in the having the original mortgage paid off and the worst case scenario would be a predatory lending agency who offers a high risk second morgartgage. Two key demographics of potential clients for this service are real estate investment companies, real estate investment funds, angel investors, issuing mortgage companies land speculators interested in holding properties for a 5-10 year period. It’s important to note the stakeholders and their impact by this solution: * The Homeowners - Impacted by the storm, this product has the potential to impact their net worth and ultimately the sell price of their property. * The City or State - Are economically incentivized to return land and local economy to post-storm levels as a humanitarian and fiscal effort to raise lost tax revenue. * The Original Mortgage Issuer - Although, likely to have been packaged and resold. The issuer essentially created a loan now with a low probability of repayment, impacting their reputation and their business. * An Outside Investor - Outside investors have the largest opportunity, with capital to flood the market they can essentially invest in crisis. How do you identify where these opportunities at their maximum and most likelihood of payout? 2.2 Client, Study Goals &amp; Project Plan: This study attempts to assess the financial real estate valuation of hurricanes and identify undervalued property post-devastation for the purposes of renovation and reinvestment. The plan to address this impact will follow the listed core assumptions laid out in the Project Plan, along with best starting points to validate those assumptions. The general theory is as follows, home values decline after the impact of a major Hurricane due to wind, water and property damage. Catastrophic damage to homes uncovered by National Flood Insurance are typically under-valued due to the owners lack of financial resources to rebuild, repair or remortgage and the corresponding damage. Next, by examining public record, the same homes impacted by the storm have recovered their value or a significant portion of their prior estimated list price, post-storm. By using these as features, and the extent of the damage, a ML model could successfully predict homes expected to be the most undervalued and the most likely to recover their value post-storm. Project Plan: Core Assumptions: 1. Home values decline after the impact of a Hurricane. 1. If they do decline, the impact follows a predictable pattern, caused by the impact of the storm. 2. Any model of property damage can be inferred on future or independant Hurricane scenarios. 2. Impacted US home values stabilize and increase 5-10 years after the impact of of a Hurricane. 1. Renovations do not cost more than the price of the home. 2. Homes sold prior to and post Hurricanes are ‘Profitable’. 3. Property Valuation and Financial Model: There are two suggested methods of opportunities when investing in disaster properties. Can a model suggesting the expected sale price of a property be validated as successful? Assumption Validation &amp; Project Plan: Assumption 1- i &amp; ii: * Using hurricanes since 2000, study landfall and determine the radius from landfall needed to assess a material impact. * Using Zillow’s API of historic property values and public record sales and purchases and Zestimate values. Study the before and after effects of the property market prior to and post-landfall. * Determine if general rules can be applied between disaster areas regarding the sale price of properties. Assumption 2- i &amp; ii: * Using Zillow’s API, looking forward in time regarding price, how long does it take the real estate market to recover their value after natural disasters? * To what extent are the homes entirely remodeled due to water damage? Assumption 3: * Based on the findings of past data, can it successfully be inferred that our model can identify properties with the highest expected ROI? Data Required: Zillow- Public Record Land Sales NOAA- National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Data NOAA- Satellite imagery near landfall of hurricane National Flood Insurance- a list of data for who is insured against floods? 2.3 Ethical Considerations, Biases and Future Plans The ethical considerations of arbitraging real estate in disaster scenarios leads itself to a natural discussion. Ultimately, damage from hurricanes are likely to materially impact the sale value of a property. Homeowners are likely to need financial relief to rebuild, which leads itself to seemingly-Faustian pacts between buyers, lenders and owners. Nothing prevents a homeowner from being ripped off on an uninsured home suffering from lack of flood insurance. It’s the homeowner who ultimately takes a loss on their property, so they aren’t financially exploited. On the positive side, the tool could also increase the number of buyers in the market and lead to a net increase in demand for damaged properties. Important to note, this tool could be biased towards buying homes in low income neighborhoods, which are less likely to own flood insurance and are more likely to be profitable because the price of the home is low. This would need to be addressed prior to release. Going forward, the application can be further built out to understand the long term impact of the economics of natural disasters on real estate. Disaster has a unique ability forcefully impact the results of normal pricing markets and the gap is ripe for a data driven company to stand-in and arbitrage the gaps. Recruitment of real estate investing companies and Angel Investors seeking to own portions of homes could help resolve the terrible implications of a Hurricane. Bibliography "],
