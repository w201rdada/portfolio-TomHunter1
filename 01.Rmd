## Goal achievement adjusted for personality differences.  

Have you ever posted to a message thread searching for advice on a goal? Dozens of strangers respond with their best ideas. The user is frantically searching for the best thread of advice, an unfortunate subject of an opaque experiment on the wisdom of the crowd. Outside of a random draw of a stranger's opinions, there's no validation, just the best advice from the most eloquent randomly-assigned stranger. What if that stranger provides advice that doesn’t quite match your personality or motivations? (I.E. the expert advising the amateur or the amateur advising journeyman). Differences in skillsets, personality, motivation, experience all play important factors in determining the sucessful outcome of the completion of a goal. This application provides a personality test, checks your motivations and goals. Then quantifies the likelihood of success between the today you, and a customized best course of SMART based action items to enable the user to accomplish the goal. Need someone to keep you committed? We can pair you with similar users aiming for the same goal and organize local meet-ups for you to interact.

## An App to Map Goals to success and to failure.

The user supplies a personality assessment and chooses from a range of predefined goals along with the ability to define their own goals. Based on the results of the personality test, previous users accomplishing this goal and the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on advice threads all of these componetns are weighted to determine the recommendation steps of the best predicted outcome. As an interface, the app creates a visualization of a decision tree with interactable probability touch points on the tree to see how completing or not completing each SMART goal influences the ultimate probability of success. 

* Use this space to talk about the research behind SMART goals
* Use this space to talk about the reserach behind Duckworth's Grit
* Use this space to talk about how this is a classifcation model and a model like logisitic regression or other ML should be used.

Beyond setting and tracking the original goal, the app prompts follow ups, and issues notifications to encourage the user to make smaller steps to enabling GRIT principles as defined by Angela Duckworth or Self-Efficacy improvement as defined by Alfred Bandura. These are prescriptive analytics customized to the specific user and are designed to increase resilience and endurance when aiming toward long term goals by issuing small lifestyle suggestions. 

## Users Improve their ability for goal setting and self achievement. 

Users have increased their ability to achieve their goals through data driven SMART goals. Our team used predictive analytics to determine most likely advice given a user’s personality to complete a given goal. Accounting for this system created new recommendations to accomplish the goal. Along the way, we used prescriptive analytics to nudge the user into developing more GRIT / Self-Efficacy, which is overall a strong predictor of goal completion, ultimately enabling the user to accomplish the tasks they set forward to do.

## Notes for Tom: Feasibility, Key Points and Data required:

Assessments: List possible personality assessments here. 
* Potential issue- Responses to personality tests often change even for one individual.  ex: Meyer’s Briggs personality tests have a high variability- find the source). Do we need to find a personality assesment with low variability.

Definition of a good goals: Goals can be well defined but determining their ultimate completion might not be cut and dry- Address with SMART goals?

Timeliness: Goals can take a long time to complete, should the app be short term focused?

Ethics?: Is it possible there could be unethical goals people are going to use the tool for? Control the goals and limit the ability of the user not to search for specific items?

Data Requirements: 
* Personality Assessments- Go find more. 
* Data regarding completion / incompletion- potential biases in data were humans do not want admit they failed a goal. 
* NLP on advice threads- Users then need to interact with this advice in order
